## **O11y One** — The Next-Generation Unified Observability Platform for the AI + Product Era

**O11y One** is a modern, end-to-end observability platform built to help companies of all sizes **streamline their
product lifecycle, optimize AI/LLM performance, and run production environments with confidence** — all while paying a
fraction of what legacy vendors (<Insert any "Logs" vendor here>) charge.

It unifies **all OpenTelemetry, Product and AI-specific signals** into a single, high-performance data plane:

- **LLM & AI observability** to ensure deterministic agent outputs, surface hidden costs, and detect performance
  bottlenecks before they impact users
- **Traces** for distributed system & model execution analysis
- **Metrics** for system health and model performance monitoring
- **Logs** for granular debugging and fine-tuning insights
- **Generic events** for business telemetry and custom workflows
- **Session replays** for UX and conversation analysis
- **Feature flags** for controlled experimentation and model rollouts

### **Core Technology Stack**

- **OpenTelemetry** for standardised, high-quality, & battle-tested telemetry.
- **Rust** for ultra-low-latency ingestion, processing, and fault tolerance
- **Apache Arrow** for in-memory, zero-copy analytics
- **Apache Parquet** for compact, query-optimized long-term storage with incremental writes
- **DataFusion** for powerful SQL-based cross-signal and cross-model correlations

### **Key Features & Advantages**

- **AI & LLM performance tracking** — monitor token usage, cost per request, latency, and output quality in real time
- **Deterministic output assurance** — correlate input prompts, context, and output variations to stabilize agent
  behavior
- **Multi-tenant isolation** with Hive-style partitioning for secure, efficient organization
- **Edge-optimized OTLP exporters** for low-latency, lossless signal forwarding
- **Schema-aware pipelines** that adapt to evolving AI and product telemetry
- **Real-time + historical analytics** in one unified interface
- **Type-safe instrumentation wrappers** for SvelteKit, Python, Go, Rust, Cloudlfare Workers, and any backend services
- **Unified correlation engine** — connect traces ↔ logs ↔ metrics ↔ events ↔ replays ↔ AI outputs in one timeline
- **State-of-the-art cost efficiency** — thanks to our Rust + Arrow + DataFusion core, you get **High value insights at
  a fraction of the cost**

By collapsing fragmented observability stacks into a **blazingly fast**, **cost-efficient**, and **AI-ready** platform,
**O11y One** transforms how teams monitor, debug, and improve both software systems and AI agents — making it easier
to **ship faster, run cheaper, and deliver reliably**.
